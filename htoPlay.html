            Scrabble is a word game for two to four players. Each player draws letter tiles, aiming to make words on the game board. The board has a grid with specific squares that offer bonus points. 
            Players take turns placing words either horizontally or vertically on the board, connecting them to existing words. Each letter has a point value, and the goal is to score the most points by creating words with high-scoring letters and placing them on premium squares. 
            Strategy involves using the board layout and available letters effectively. It's a fun game that also enhances vocabulary and spelling skills. </p>
